### What is Angular, Why Angular?
Angular: JS framework for building client-side applications

Why angular? Makes our HTML more expressive; powerful data binding; modular by design (easier to create content); built in back end integration

Why a new Angular? Built for speed (improve render times); modern (classes, modules, support new and existing browsers); simplified API; Angular enhances productivity


Companies with Angular: McDonald, Autodesk,

### Angular Module: a class with an NgModule decorator (organize pieces of our application and arrange them into blocks)
Loaded when application starts or lazy loaded

Import { NgModule } from ‘@angular/core’;
@NgModule({

bootstrap: [] ← define components

})

#### Angular components: basic building blocks of apps (necessary imports, decorator, class where component logic is stored)
 
import 
@component
export class AppComponent { title =  “app”}

#### Templates – HTML, how to render Component

Template 
“<h1>{{pageTitle}}</h1>”
Better to use a URL 
templateURL:  ‘/style/component/etc’;
styleURLS:

3 things to make components work: component, template, metadata

Metadata: gives info to Angular where components are built

Data binding: 
Interpolation: Component to DOM
One way binding: Component to DOM


Event binding: DOM to Component
Two way binding: both ways

#### Services: a class with a focused purpose
Provides anything a component needs
Export class myService()
Injector contains the service instance (singleton)
Component class defines service as a dependency
Injector to component is a service injection
Constructor (private _myservice)

#### Routing
Route - configure a route for each component
